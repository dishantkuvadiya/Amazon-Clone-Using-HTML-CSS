author: dishant kuvadiya

About thhis repo:
This project is a simple clone of the Amazon India homepage built using HTML5 and CSS3. It was created for learning and practice purposes to improve my frontend development skills, especially in structuring web pages using HTML and styling them using CSS.

🔍 Project Overview
The Amazon Home Page Clone replicates the layout and design of the official Amazon India website. It includes key sections such as:

•🔝 Top navigation bar (search bar, login, cart, etc.)

•🧭 Category and menu bar

•🖼️ Banner section

•🛍️ Product cards and rows

•📦 Footer layout

This project focuses purely on frontend design, with no JavaScript or backend functionality. It is a static webpage that aims to closely match the real homepage layout of Amazon.
